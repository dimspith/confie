### :gear: The portable configuration manager

## What is confie?
Confie aims to be a portable and extensible configuration manager for the everyday user 
to simplify the process of maintaining a system's settings and configuration
files and transferring them with ease across different installations. The project is still
in it's really early stages with no useful functionality at the moment
but this will change soon!

All work that's being done is located in the `develop` branch.

## Installation
To build from source, just run `nimble build`. An executable will appear in the project folder.

## Why Nim?
We chose [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) for this project because of it's easy interoperability with C
and strong emphasis on static compilation. Even though it's a relatively new language it facilitates
the generation of small static binaries which we believe are essential for portability and it's amazing
type system makes working with it a joy.
