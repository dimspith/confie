# TODO LIST

This is a TODO list containing features we want in confie and all the things we are currently working on implementing/improving. This file will change often as we form a better development plan so stay tuned!

## Project overview

Our goal for confie is to have a small static binary that both casual and advanced users can utilize to maintain their systems. The current overview we have of the project is as follows:

* Confie will use a configuration file in one of the known formats to hold all the user-specified options. If instead of a file, the user specifies a directory, confie should be able to automatically detect and validate the user's setup.
* It will have some kind of mechanism to sync dotfiles from a repository or folder collection in a similar way to [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
* It will be able to detect and have different options for different package managers and the setup should be distro agnostic.
